This repository is for an app dedicated to informing its users in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu rules set by UAEJJF.

As a mixed martial arts enthusiast and a BJJ fanatic, I have written this simple app to view UAEJJF rules on mobile. 
This app is set to be used by MJJF to promote BJJ rules. 

This app aims to support 2 languages (English and Mongolian).
