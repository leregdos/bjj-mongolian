This repository is for an app dedicated to informing its users in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu rules set by JJAU (Jiu-Jitsu Asian Union).

As a mixed martial arts enthusiast and a BJJ fanatic, I have written this simple app to view JJAU rules on mobile. 
This app is set to be used by MJJF (Mongolian Jiu-Jitsu Federation) to promote BJJ rules. 

This app aims to support 2 languages (English and Mongolian).
